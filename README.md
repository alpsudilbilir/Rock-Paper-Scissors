## How to play âœ‚
 Rules are basic.
- Rock beats scissors.
- Paper beats rock.
- Scissors beats paper.
- User just have to pick one of the choices(rock, paper, scissors) and your enemy(basicly phone) will pick random choice.

## The Goal of The Project
The aim is developing basic game to improve swift and swiftUI core skills. Also gaining some knowledge about how to work with animations.

## Design ðŸ“±
I used simple design. We have score text and 2 numbers that shows user score and computer score. Also you can see 3 buttons and 1 image under the score texts. At the very bottom you can see next round button to reset the game and switch the next round.
